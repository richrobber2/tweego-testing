Being swept in from your excitement, you realize you forgot to check when LO-Mart opens! Without skipping a beat, you face the automatic doors and look at the store hours sign:

@@#EffectText;

	OPEN:
	9:00am
	Closed:
	10:00pm

Closed on weekends.

Okay, that's good to know! At least you can take $Arisa to school in the morning. If youâ€™re lucky enough, you could use your lunch break to walk your home as well.

...

With that out of the way you walk away from LO-Mart and see a bench not too far from the entrance.
