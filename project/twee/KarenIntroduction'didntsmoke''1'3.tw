Acting without common sense, you jump forward from the bench and slam your body on the pavement in front of her.

'THUD'

$Karen's body land hard on your rag dolled body and you cushion her fall. Her impact causes your face to bounce on the ground.

While you're lying on the parking lot in pain, you look up to see $Karen still on top of you, looking at you with widened eyes.

Still recuperating, you say,

"Are you alright? Ugh, that hurt...‚Äù

For a single frame of vision, you witness the girl smile then shiftily jump backwards while placing a hand on her skirt.

$Karen:

"Th-um...Are you retarded or something?! You made me trip!"

You slowly get up in a wary daze. While you don't appear to be injured you think she would have been injured if you didn't do that.

Instead of getting angry at her insults, you brush off your cloths then let out a breath of relief.

"Sorry but if I didn't do that you would have fell pretty hard."

$Karen brushes her skirt off and readjusts her purse on her shoulder.

"Great, now I'm all dusty! Thanks a lot dork!"

$Karen glares at you then cocks her head away from you.

"Humph! I'm outta here! Thanks for nothing jackass!"

What a bitch!

You almost injure yourself cushioning her and she doesn't even thank you?! Oh well, you can't make everyone happy.

You watch as the brat heads back towards the sidewalk and disappear down the road.

...

You take moment to recover from your fall, then you retrieve your lighter from off the bench and decide you should probably head back home; $Arisa must be waiting for you.
