Your sister starts to rub her eyes then without warning, lays her soft, tiny hand on your face and kisses your slightly agap mouth.

You can't fight back as your sister starts to hold a tongue kiss for a few seconds then releases you with a notable 'Pop!â€™

Achieving <<timed 1.6s>>her daily quest to kiss you, she licks some of your drool off your bottom lip<</timed>> and pushes you back on your bed. Amidst of you falling, you hear your bedroom door slam so loud it shakes the walls.
