This is a great deal! Even is $Amber seems a little unhinged, a thousand dollars and four hundred dollars down! If you play your cards right, this could actually work out well!

You put the money into your pocket and offer $Amber a handshake.

<<if $PayRaise1 is 0>>\
Although you don't know if you're being low-balled, you feel like this could work out well. Eight hundred dollars a week might be just enough to live off of. If you play your cards right, things might actually work out!

You hesitantly extend your arm and offer $Amber a handshake.

She stares dumbfound into the ceiling until it clicks. Possibly not expecting you to accept her offer, she suddenly jumps over her desk and tackles you with a unexpected embrace.

She then jumps on her desk like a frog and starts to tap-dance on her desk; causing her papers and office supplies to scatter to the floor.

After her brief celebration, she jumps off her desk and while humming a tone (which you recognize as an anime opening theme song), she reaches into her pockets and offers you a nametag.
