"Well, I'm glad I could help you. You actually look a lot more mature with glasses on! You also look really cute with your hair down!"

You nervously laugh but your awkward gesture makes $Karen look away from you and blushes a noticeable shade of red.

While you stare at her you also notice her whispering something.

$Karen (Whispering):

"An adult just complimented me. Calm down $Karen, You're an adult you can act normal. Itâ€™s cool."

She then looks back to you as if you didn't just hear what she said and smiles again at you.

$Karen:

"Th-Thanks! Us adults always try to look our best! Umm... So $Name, you come her often?"

Her voice isn't as loud and confident as it was earlier but you ignore this, take a quick puff of your smoke and say,

$Name:

"No I don't but I did just get hired here not to long ago. Why did you ask?"

$Karen takes a step back and starts to twirl her hair with her fingers.

$Karen:

"Well, How about we hang out tomorrow? I come her a lot and-..."

But before she can finish her sentence, she turns around and starts to run off.

You call out her name but she is already running down the road while covering her still radiate face.

...What an odd girl.

After watching the girl run out of your sight, you take a few more puffs off your cigarette and prematurely stub it out on the bench.

With that done, you decide to collect your thing and head back home.

$Arisa must be eager to see how today went.
