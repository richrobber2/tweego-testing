Taking the boring trek back home you're amazed by the amount of things that transpired today. At a leisurely pace, you take a moment and thing about the people you met today.

You stop walking for a moment and retrieve the card Principal Iratu oddly gave to you. Looking down at the well embossed 'calling' card you notice some there is some writing on it:

      ATF
"All the Fallen"

Under the font is this piano black, glossy card is also a black RFID square with a rabbit design in the middle.

What a strange item.

With that, you put the card back into your shirt pocket and continue walking.

 It was great to not only see $Amber again, but to think she is the one who runs LO-Mart. While you admit she is a tad strange and possibly a threat to little kids, she has proved that she is a caring person by being so eager to hire you but also by giving you four hundred dollars and giving you a pay raise before you even started working. She may seem like a violent and possibly crazy girl but her heart seems to be in the right place. You wonder if you can get her to stop calling you oniichan but then again she is going paying you well.

  It was great to not only see $Amber again, but to think she is the one who runs LO-Mart. Although she seems a little unhinged, she has done a lot to get where she's at today. Although you admit you envy that, you feel like the pressure of her running the store kind of left her a mess of her former self.
