$Karen takes the twenty dollar bill out of her panties and places it inside a small, blue purse she had slung over her shoulder. She then looks away from you and starts to twist her hair.

Wait? She was just acting like that? What kind of friends does she have?!

$Karen walks up to you then grabs one of your hands.

No way! This can't be the same girl from earlier. You just assumed she was some kind of delinquent but now she's acting like a normal school girl.

$Karen tugs on your hand and smiles; she seems happy that she did a good job.

With that, the blue haired $Karen spun around in joy and walked towards the sidewalk.

Although you feel bad for exploiting a kid like that, it seemed to make her happy...and twenty dollars richer.

...

Once the blue haired nymph is out of your sight, you decide it'll be a good time to head home and tell $Arisa the good news.

She must be worried.
