Upon hearing the word, you both dash toward second base, third, then back to home plate. The first lap was easy enough but the small red-head is right beside you.

Feeling surprised you are not too winded, you pick up the pace and manage a six inch gap ahead of her.

As you run, you start to envision images of the past. Beside $Redia, you can see a younger you running as well.

Upon hearing this, you wipe the sweat off your cheeks and pace faster.

Running behind you, Coach Dimby firmly kicks you in the tush.

You yelp slightly and attempt to cover more ground just to flee from his onslaught.

Coach Dimby draws closer as you are trying to escape.

"No, you're slow! Prove him wrong!‚Äù The voices in your head yell.

DAMN IT! You can't let this go on! You tried so hard to get this far, the team is the only family you have!

You break the illusion to find yourself still running against $Redia. You don't know what lap your on but you know $Redia is behind you.

In the midst of your panting breath, you can hear a sentence escape her mouth.

"Augh, DAMN IT! I can't let this go on!"

You quickly look back and notice her slowing down.
