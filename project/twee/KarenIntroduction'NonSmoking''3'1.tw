Although she tried to bribe you for your name tag earlier, you honestly can't see a kid willingly want to smoke cigarette. She must be saying it for attention.

Putting your wallet back in your pocket, you hand politely hand $Karen the twenty dollar bill and she early snatches it from you.

That's when you notice she isnâ€™t listening to you at all! $Karen is mesmerized by the newfound wealth in her hands.

You look at the bewildered girl; smiling.

After marveling at the bill for what feels like minutes, she stuffs the crisp twenty into a small blue purse that she had hanging on her shoulder and smiles at you.

$Karen sticks her tongue at you then turns around and runs off towards the road; leaving you both confused and twenty dollars short.

After watching $Karen joyfully skip away out of your sight, you decide it's probably a good time to head home.

$Arisa is probably waiting for you.
