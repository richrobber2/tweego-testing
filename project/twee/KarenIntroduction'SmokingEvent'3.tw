A sting of words are flashing into your brain.
<<set $Fatigue += 10>>\
SMOKE! Take a breather! You deserve to smoke! You're only making yourself suffer.

You feel a bead of sweat run down your face as the urge to smoke start to wash over your reasoning. You want to smoke! You make this choice long ago to smoke; why are you fighting it now! Who cares with $Arisa thinks! She's just a kid.

You deserve to smoke after all the trouble she puts you through.

â€¦

...No, it isn't.

You're just making excuses to smoke but you feel yourself automatically jumping to excuses of why you need to smoke.

You want to smoke but (at the same time), you don't want to.

You regain your focus and find your grasp crushing the box.
