Seeing the girl in distress you can't turn away! Emptying your pockets, you dive into the pond.

"SPLASH!"

You find yourself surrounded by deafening silence, blanketed in crisp, cooling water.

 Taking a second to adjust your vision, you see a small, green haired girl trusting wildly; you eventually see he leg is stuck on a tree vine.

 Not accounting for this turn of events, you swim towards the tiny girl and effortlessly untangle her oddly small feet.

 Running out of breath, you wrap your arms around the child's waist and peddled to shore.

 ...

 Once on shore, you sling the girl into your chest and take a few, swift breaths.

 You look down and notice the green haired girl cradled in your arms.

 She has long, green hair tied into two large braids of pig tails. Dressed in a handmade palm tree leave dress, she appears naked underneath as her loose cloths sag and reveal her almost un-noticeable breasts.

 The girl is tiny! She can't be taller than three feet while she appearance looks like that of a preteen. Her skin is tanned with long exposure to the sun, revealing itâ€™s self as a contrast to her pale complexion behind her leaves.
