You smile and begin to pat $Redia's wet hair.

$Redia grabs your hand and forces you to rub her head harder.

You continue,

You stop talking but she already heard enough to know what you meant.

Randomly, $Redia ran out of the showers and headed toward her cloths. Interested and slightly confused, you walk towards her.

You stand behind her while she starts fishing through her sweat pants then pulls out your 'Game LoliÂ©' and looks over at you with a childish grin.

Her talking about 'Loli'Mon' brings a nostalgic memory of playing with your old friends. It is almost refreshing to hear someone get so excited about it nowadays.

$Redia switched the game 'ON' but the screen blacks out. $Redia franticly toggles the switch then emits a 'boo'; admitting defeat.

While she seemed bummed about this, $Redia places her sweatpants back on and stuffs the handheld into her pocket.

After a quick stretch, she reaches toward the floor to find her red sweat jacket dripping wet in a puddle of water.

$Redia:

"Oh No! My jacket got wet!"

She picks up the soiled jacket and watches as water drips out of it.
