What a selfish excuse; you bet that he's confusing his sister's love as non-sibling love.

"What does that have to do with your sister? Who cares about your sexuality! I bet your sister's wellbeing is more important than your pity grip on sexuality!"

The boy looks at you, possibly offended and yells,

"I'm sure you'd never understand having a sister that loves you that way! It's because of her I decided to only like boys! But you! Oh, you're just an ass!"

With that, the boy smiles and leaves on his adventure to find his sister.
